# Bayesian-Based A/B Testing Tool

This is a Bayesian-based A/B testing tool designed to facilitate Monte Carlo simulations using posterior distributions. By leveraging Monte Carlo simulations, this tool enables the calculation of expected differences in complex metrics, which are often challenging to compute using traditional statistical methods.

## Features

- **Bayesian Inference**: Utilize Bayesian methods to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence becomes available.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Conduct robust simulations to estimate the distribution of complex metrics.
- **Complex Metric Calculation**: Calculate expected differences in complex metrics that are difficult to determine with traditional A/B testing approaches.
